The CEM is a JSON file that describes the custom elements used in a web project. 
If you've never worked with the CEM before, you can think of it as all of the meta-data about your components and their APIs.
At first glance, the CEM can be a bit overwhelming, but the CEM utilities are here to help!

The CEM utilities are collection of functions for working with the Custom Elements Manifest (CEM). 
They provide a way to retrieve and transform data from the CEM, making it easier to use the documentation for your web components.
